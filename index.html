Dr. Özel develops theoretical and computational methods to study black holes and neutron stars and to build models of their extreme environments. She pioneered a new technique that allowed her to make the first accurate measurement of neutron star radii and to derive significant constraints on the cold dense matter equation of state. She also made the first predictions of the images of nearby supermassive black holes at different wavelengths based on her work on accretion flows, which guided the development of the Event Horizon Telescope. -->
